# Books

> After all any book is just a list of thoughts of another guy, who might be wrong.

This file is the ultimate list of books that I have read, and that I'm reading currently. So, in a way, this is my way of getting rid of GoodReads because... well, I I don't think that there's any need to use a service that could be replaced almost fully by something as simple as a single text file.
