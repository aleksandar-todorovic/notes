# Books

> After all any book is just a list of thoughts of another guy, who might be wrong.

This file is the exported version of my [Goodreads `read` shelf](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/37688006-aleksandar-todorovi?shelf=read), synced using my [`goodreads_to_md_list.py`](https://github.com/aleksandar-todorovic/automation-scripts#goodreads_to_md_listpy) script. Having a Git backup prevents me from feeling that I might be vendor-locked-in, even though it's just a freaking list of books that I could probably re-create.

The books below are in order of me marking them as read on Goodreads, from oldest to newest. The stars are my subjective opinion of the book on the scale from one to five.

Format: ``* `author_name` book_title (rating) [[isbn13](link_to_goodreads)]``
