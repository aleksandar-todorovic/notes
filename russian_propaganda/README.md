# Russian Propaganda

> Russian authors understand ‘information warfare’ as influencing the consciousness of the masses as part of the rivalry between the different civilisational systems adopted by different countries in the information space by use of special means to control information resources as ‘information weapons’. They thus mix the military and non-military order and the technological (cyberspace) and social order (information space) by definition, and make direct references to ‘Cold War’ and ‘psychological warfare’ between the East and the West.

Information as a dangerous weapon:

* it is cheap,
* it is a universal weapon,
* it has unlimited range,
* it is easily accessible and permeates all state borders without restrictions).

**Timeline:**

* [RIA Novosti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RIA_Novosti) founded in 1941. Russian Unitary enterprise<sup>1</sup>.
* In 2005, RIA Novosti launched RT (originally Russia Today), a global multilingual television news network, which is a government-funded but non-profit organization.
* [RIA Novosti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RIA_Novosti) - Reported in English until December 9th 2013, when Russian President Vladimir Putin signed its liquidation (that happened on April 1st 2014).
* On the same day (December 9th 2013) RIA Novosti merges with the [Voice of Russia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_of_Russia) to create Rossiya Segodnya.
* [Rossiya Segodnya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rossiya_Segodnya) (founded on December 9th 2013) is "wholly owned by the Government of Russia as a unitary enterprise<sup>1</sup>".
* Started expanding into Baltic region in April 2014 under the name Baltnews, which was [discovered](https://en.rebaltica.lv/2017/04/sputniks-unknown-brother/) three years later.
* Voice of Russia gets dissolved on November 9th 2014.
* [Sputnik](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sputnik_(news_agency)) launched as a subsidiary of Rossiya Segodnya on November 10th 2014.

<sup>1</sup> Unitary enterprise: Government-owned corporation. Business entities have no ownership rights to the assets they use. Its profits go directly to the state.

According to paragraph 15(a) of Russia’s military doctrine, updated and approved in December 2014:

> Characteristic features and specifics of current military conflicts are: a) integrated employment of military force and political, economic, informational or other non-military measures implemented with a wide use of the protest potential of the population and of special operations forces;

Sputnik's modus operandi in Central Eastern Europe: select a small number of anti-establishment politicians and give them substantial coverage, while reporting little or nothing about the representatives of other parties or points of view.

Example: Janusz Korwin-Mikke, Polish presidential candidate in 2015, referenced on Sputnik ~10 times, received 3% of the votes, while Pawel Kukiz got referenced three times, even though he got six times more votes.

[This thread](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14226670) gave some insights of what's happening in the Baltic states. Key points:

* Russians don't feel the need to integrate with the local culture.
* They only consume Russian-speaking media.
* They see the reunification with Russia as the best choice.
* To their little nations, it's seen as a case of fighting for the survival of their culture.
